# Haskell Undefined Value Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming: attempting to use an undefined value.  The `undefined` value represents a computation that has not been assigned a concrete value.  Trying to perform operations on `undefined` results in a runtime error.

The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.hs` file shows how to correct this error by providing a proper value.

This example highlights the importance of type safety and proper value assignment in Haskell.
